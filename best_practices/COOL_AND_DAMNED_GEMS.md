## Damned Gems - AVOID THEM LIKE THE PLAGUE!

- Anything named `acts_as_*`: Gems named on an old custom are old.
- `paranoia`: Changing the method signature of `#destroy` is asking for trouble. Use [jhawthorn/discard](https://github.com/jhawthorn/discard) instead.
- `state_machine`: Old and abandoned. Also `state_machines` which is a fork of the old one. Use `statesman` instead.
