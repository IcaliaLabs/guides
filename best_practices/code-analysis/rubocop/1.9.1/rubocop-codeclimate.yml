# Given that all configuration inherits from RuboCop's default configuration
# - see https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/configuration.html#inheritance - we
# will just add corrections over the default configuration instead:
Metrics/BlockLength:
  IgnoredMethods:
    - configure # Ignore the typical configuration blocks
    - describe  # Ignore RSpec "describe" blocks
    - context   # Ignore RSpec "context" blocks
    - namespace # Ignore Rake tasks namespace blocks on lib/tasks folder

# Let's disable all cops that are already implemented as maintainability checks
# on CodeClimate:

# This cop has been implemented as the "method-lines" maintainability check:
Metrics/MethodLength:
  enabled: false

# This cop has been implemented as the "argument-count" maintainability check:
Metrics/ParameterLists:
  enabled: false

# This cop has been implemented as the "method-complexity" maintainability check:
Metrics/PerceivedComplexity:
  enabled: false
