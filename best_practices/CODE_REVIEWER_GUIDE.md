# Code Reviewer Guide

## Checklist

Whenever any of these fails, stop the review and ask the developer to fix the issue.

- It's base is `master` or any `epic` branch? *We shouldn't even spend time on PR's not based on any of these two.*

  - If it is an `epic` branch, does it have a pending Pull Request? *We might end up accepting changes without visibility to the team*

- Code is up-to-date with the base branch? *We might end up reviewing & accepting code that is not yet finished (because it's still subject to change*

- Tests & other build processes are all passing?
