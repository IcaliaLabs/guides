# Best practices

We like to keep sanity on every project and, in order to achieve that, we have a
set of best practices for each stack, you can find them on the following links:

* [Project Setup](PROJECT_SETUP_GUIDE.md)(for all projects)
* [Docker](../stack/docker)
* [Rails](../stack/rails/BEST_PRACTICES.md)
* [Ruby](../stack/ruby/BEST_PRACTICES.md)
* [Git & Icalia Code Flow](../stack/git/)(See also [Code Reviewer Guide](CODE_REVIEWER_GUIDE.md))
* [Code Analysis](code-analysis)

We do have some general guides every Icalier must follow, not just for us as a
team but as a personal investment:

* Don't follow instructions without asking why
* Don't reinvent the wheel, use libraries, gems or plugins
* Ask for help or code review if you feel insecure about something
* Avoid writing code for the "future" functionality or trying to guess
* Have fun and keep things as simple as possible
