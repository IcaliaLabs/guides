## Fixing Bugs on OSS libraries

Whenever we find ourselves in the need of issuing fixes to open-source libraries
(gems, npm packages, etc) that are being used in our projects, CI/CD processes,
etc., we should follow these considerations:

### 1: Report the issue on the OSS project upstream

Be courteous when reporting the problem. Most of the OSS projects are maintained
by people like you and me, and deserve respect.

### 2: Create an example project that helps replicating the problem

### 3: Share the example project in the issue thread

### 4: Fork the repo in the IcaliaLabs organization

Due to the fact that we might need the fix before it's merged back to upstream,
we certainly need to maintain the repository while the fix makes it's way into
upstream. The best way to ensure everything keeps that way in the meantime is
to have the repo in the IcaliaLabs organization at GitHub.

### 5: Work to fix the issue

Work in a new branch. Follow the conventions used by the upstream project - including
branch names.

Remember to keep the changes minimal. Address unrelated issues in a different
branch/pull request.
