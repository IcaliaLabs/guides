# iOS GUIDELINES

The following guides are a compilation of common practices and conventions we use in Icalia for iOS Projects. We believe it's very important to have a look at this guides to have a common ground in our development style, and make it easier to work in teams or, also, to retake a project made by another teammate without wasting time understanding the structure and tools used in the project.
