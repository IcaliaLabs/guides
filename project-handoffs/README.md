# Project Handoff Checklist


## Requirements for clients

- [ ] Github.com organization or user to transfer the apps
  - [ ] Target Github Organization should have a paid plan (5 users at $25 USD a month)
  - [ ] As an alternative, we can transfer to individual accounts, but process is a bit tricky / undesireable:
    1. Repo should be transferred to an individual account in the source organization - adding the target individual to the source organization may be possible, but it might add to the available seats, have access to other info within the organization, etc.
    2. The individual should transfer the repo to the target individual account - there's no way to complete this without the target account's owner to accept the transfer following a link in an email message.
- [ ] Heroku team to transfer pipelines
- [ ] ???
