# Suggested Protocol
In order to use this simple template, you need to have the following:

1. GPA
Go to Foresight find it or run locally codeclimate: https://github.com/IcaliaLabs/guides/tree/master/best_practices/code-analysis

2. Test Coverage
Go to Foresight find it (right now, Jul the 1st, this feature is still on WIP by Vovs). 
You can clone the repo and run it by yourself.

3. The previous steps can be done on a PR (branch) or master. It's up to you. Add the PR reference if so.

4. If you find helpful to point out some github issues, please do.

Once you have compiled the aforementioned information, then:

1. Review Foresight detected issues. 
2. If you find a pattern (this is something that has happened before with the same icalier), take notes. 
This is probably something that can be automatized.
3. Look for websites or resources related to the issues. 
This is very important. You want icaliers to be self-sufficient, self-taught.
4. Take notes for yourself. 
You can also learn something.
5. Try to categorize the issues into areas to tackle.
It's better to group things into categories, it gives meaning and easy to handle.
6. Once you get all the data you need, prepare material for a pair-programming session.
The material can be either something new or work on the current project. The idea is to level up, together.
7. Schedule the pair-programming session.
8. Send this template (fill it out with real information, obviously) to the icalier email.
9. Keep track of the stats.
Always.

**Feedback**

I don't know who you are icalier. I don't know what I am. 
If you are looking for excelsior, I can tell you I cant help you out. 
But what I do have are a very particular set of skills, 
skills I have acquired over a very long career. 
Skills that make me a CTO's nightmare. 
If you let my Vovs go now, that'll be the end of it. 
I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. 
But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will refactor you.
