## How to contribute to <PROJECT_NAME>

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/IcaliaLabs/<PROJECT_NAME>/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/IcaliaLabs/<PROJECT_NAME>/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring. Also add a `bug` tag to it.

#### **Are you ready to place a pull request?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* We use a pull request template so that you don't have to worry about the format, but make sure you include the following:
	* Make sure to list the problems you are addressing
	* Include the relevant issue number if applicable
	* Review the linters checklist
* When submitting a pull request you can make use of two tag titles, which helps the code reviewers to notice about the status of the pull request, for example if you need the pull request to be checked right away you can add into de title something like - `[URGENT] This is the pull request title` - but there are some other times you have work pending on the pull request, in that case the tag would be - `[WIP] This is the pull request title`
* Whenever you are ready to request a review, just remove any title tag(WIP or URGENT) and assign the code reviewer, otherwise it won't be reviewed

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

For changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of <PROJECT_NAME>, just add a title tag of `[COSMETIC]` and assign the code reviewer.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question related to the project, you can ask any of the members listed in the [README](README.md).

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
