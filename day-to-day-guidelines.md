# Day to day Guidelines

## General

## About Development Process

- **Refactoring is a required fix, not an optional chore:** At the time it is written, code might be "good", "perfomant", "readable", "secure", etc.
  But the software ecosystem is a living beast that changes every day. New information, discoveries, and progress can change how we perceive 
  abd understand existing code. Refactoring is to an ongoing project what eating is to us: You might stop eating, and survive for 40 days... but at
  some point you'll die of starvation.
