# Developer Manifesto?

## General

## About Development Process

- **Software is a living beast:**
- **Refactoring is a required fix, not an optional chore:** At the time it is written, code might be "good", "perfomant", "readable", "secure", etc.
  But the software ecosystem - being comprised of *living beasts* - changes every day. New discoveries are constantly changing how we perceive 
  and understand code. Refactoring is to an ongoing project what eating is to us: You might stop eating, and survive for 40 days... but at
  some point you'll die of starvation.
- **Knowledge before automation:** While it's cool to have tools that automate repetitive, or even difficult tasks (and we're fans of it!), this doesn't
  do jack shit if we don't understand what's going on behind doors. Before any attempt at automation, we'll preffer to first write about it, teach it,
  and only then should we automate it.
