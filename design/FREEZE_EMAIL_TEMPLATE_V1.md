Hello <CLIENT_NAME>,

First of all we'd like to say thanks for believeing in us and letingt us share these past two weeks with you. You should congratulate yourself, it's been quite a ride and you made a lot of important decisions in just a couple of days.

The next big step is to review the Statement of Work, which you can find attached to this email.

This document describes the scope for your MVP(Minumum Viable Product) from a design and functionality perspective and will allow us to start making your idea come true.

There is no rush in signing this document. Take a breath, talk to your team, take it for a last spin and, whenever you are ready, we will be happy to start.

We'll be at your service in case you need anything else or if you have questions or comments regarding this.

Again, thanks for the time and effort you put on these 2 weeks.

Best,
