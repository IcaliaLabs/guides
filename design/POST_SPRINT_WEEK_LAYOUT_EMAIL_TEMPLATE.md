Hello <CLIENT_NAME>,

We hope you're having an amazing start this week.

We'd like to remind you what the next steps for us will be on this week: 

Today and tomorrow we'll be working on adjusting and writing down all the User Stories pertaining to the MVP, based on the prototype and all the feedback we got from you and your team.

We'll be working on the rest of the deliverables, such as the report, which we should have ready by Wednesday afternoon and review it together on Thursday.

Once we have an agreement on the final user stories plus the adjusted prototype (which will serve as a visual guide), we can do a Design and Scope Freeze so we can get to work on the MVP.

We'll be at your service in case you need anything else or if you have questions or comments regarding this.

Best,
