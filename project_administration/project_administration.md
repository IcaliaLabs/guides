#Manual / Tips

Will dive this guide on 4 parts. 1st part will be the begging of the project, the 2nd part will talk about the continuous deliveries you’ll be making along the development process, and the 3rd one will talk about the changes the client will ask during the project development (trust us those will always come), lastly the 4th is the closing of the project.

1st Beginning of the project (Definition)

- Make sure that when you start a project, you establish the reach of the project. This means setting the capabilities or features it’ll posses at the end of it. This part is extremely important since it will help you define the MVP when we talk about a new project, or the new features or fixes that will have to be develop on an existing product. 
- After all of this has been established make sure the client understands the capabilities or changes that the product will have by the end of the project.

2nd Continuous delivery

We have found that stabling continuous meeting the client and on each one of this meetings showing the so far progress, helps to maintain the trust relationship between the client and us. As well, as setting a great opportunity for spotting early changes on the product. Many times since you are showing the client how the product is taking form, they can come to see, that this is not what they had in mind (here comes the changes). Thanks to this, we can make the change on early development stage.

- Try to set this meeting as often as any major develop comes so the client can keep up with the status of the product and keeps the trust that is moving forward.
- When working remote, is important to at least manage some presence meetings.
- Continuous delivery helps you keep a good track of the time you are have and the status you are on, before the release. 

3rd Changes

This part is really crucial since here is where most of the pain comes so will try to help you avoid them. 
- When having a meeting with a client regarding a redefinition to the product, or a new feature to be develop, make sure to always take note on what it was discussed during the meeting, have this notes saved in a digital format so that it can be send to the client and have them approved by them before any changes are made. 
- If the client ask for a changes, make sure it’s regarding an existing feature or a change on something that was in the reach of the definition, and not a whole new feature.

4th Delivery

For the delivery of the project it may depend of the development platform on which the project was built. Take a look at the Project Transition Guide for more detail of this.
