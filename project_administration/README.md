#Project Administration

Now on day, many developers are assigned or have to take the role of not only work as a developer on a project, but also to take the lead and admistrate it as well.

Some of us here at Icalia, have suffered the pain of going down that road many times. So will try to give you some tips on how to do this task, as easy as possible. 

Again this is based on our own experience, so any comments or tips are more than welcome.
