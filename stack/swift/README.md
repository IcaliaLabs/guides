## Fundamentals

  * Use english to code.
  * Use camel case. For example:
    ```swift
      let isCorrect: Bool
    ```
  * Use descriptive code, clarity is more important than brevity. For example:
    ```swift
      let isFriday: Bool {}
      if isFriday {
        print("Friday!!!!")
      }
    ```  

## Swift style guide

  * https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/
  * https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide


## Swiftlint

 * Swiftlint is a tool to enforce swift style and conventions, here the  link to its github https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/.

 * Here are the set of rules that we use:

  ```yml
    disabled_rules:
    - control_statement
    - line_length
    - trailing_whitespace
    - force_cast
    - class_delegate_protocol
    - weak_delegate

    opt_in_rules:
    - empty_count

    excluded:
    - Pods

    vertical_whitespace:
    max_empty_lines: 2

    file_length:
    warning: 500
    error: 1000
  ```

# IOS  

## IOS App Architecture

  There are many architectures developers use to build IOS apps, MVC (Model View Controller), is Apple recommended architecture pattern.

  * Here's a Icalia Labs blog by Daniel Lozano which we recommend reading: [Introduction to iOS App Architectures](https://medium.com/sudo-by-icalia-labs/introduction-to-ios-app-architectures-59f86801a2ad)

## Api Client Setup

  Many IOS applications use external Api, this is a setup which might come useful.

  * This setup uses a singleton class, ApiClient in which the api methods are written.

  ```swift
    class ApiClient {
        static let shared = ApiClient()
      ...
    }

  ```
  * Its also useful to divide the url endpoints to the base url

  ```swift
    enum Endpoints {
    case .getNames
     ...  
    }
  ```

  * The methods use completion handlers. Something like this:

  ```swift
     func getNames(completion: @escaping (Result(T))) {
       ...
       if error != nil {
           completion(.error)
       } else {
         completion(.success(names))
       }
     }
  ```

## Building views form xib's

  Building views from xib's can be useful, to do this we recommend following steps shown in this post, [Loading views from XIBâ€™s on iOS](https://medium.com/sudo-by-icalia-labs/loading-views-from-xibs-on-ios-29d008eda85c), from Icalia Labs blog by Daniel Lozano.

## Project structure for MVC

  * As for folder structure, follow something like this:
    * Models
    * Views
    * Controllers
    * Others

## Pod installations  

  * [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. It has over 40 thousand libraries and is used in over 2.8 million apps. CocoaPods can help you scale your projects elegantly. (Taken from https://cocoapods.org)

  * Pods of Icalia Labs:

    * [Presentr](https://github.com/IcaliaLabs/Presentr)
    * [LoginKit](https://github.com/IcaliaLabs/LoginKit)


  * Pods that we use in Icalia Labs:

    * [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire)
    * [AlamofireImage](https://github.com/Alamofire/AlamofireImage)
    * [IHKeyboardAvoiding](https://github.com/IdleHandsApps/IHKeyboardAvoiding)
    * [SideMenu](https://github.com/jonkykong/SideMenu)

## Swift Packet Manager

  * Swift Packet Manager is used to create swift libraries and and command line apps in macOS.

  ```
    mkdir CommandLineApp
    cd CommandLineApp
    swift package init --type executable
  ```
