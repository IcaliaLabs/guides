# Docker Swarm

## Why Swarm over Rancher?

Rancher was our preferred cluster administration tool on 2015 & early 2016. Since mid-2016, Swarm
comes now by default with the Docker Engine (since version 1.12). It has scheduling, routing mesh
(by port) and health check etc. It is far easier to setup and with minimal requirements over a more complex setup with Rancher. Besides, we're shedding off the weight of "multiple-vendor complexity"
for this task.

However, if our client really needs deployment to their own infrastructure (servers, networks, etc), *AND* commercial support is required, we MUST recommend Docker Data Center's Universal Control Plane (UCP, for which we're the first Docker partner here in MÃ©xico)

## Enabling a Docker Swarm Cluster

### 1: Enable access to the remote engines over TCP

Although you can launch services and stacks from any of the swarm manager nodes, it is more useful
to connect your host's docker client - where you have all of your compose files & other configs - to
any of the remote swarm managers.

This guide assumes that the engine is installed on a Debian Jessie machine, which uses systemd to
start the docker daemon. This part of the guide is based on:

 - [Control and configure Docker with systemd](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/systemd)
 - [Protect the Docker daemon socket](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/https)

#### 1.1: Enabling unsecured access from the outside (baby steps first!)

We'll need re-configure the engine to start the engine listening to both the local Unix socket
*AND* the unsecure HTTP socket on TCP port 2375.

First, configure the remote server's firewall (or network security group on AWS/Azure) settings, so
the engine is accessible at the **TCP port 2375**.

On the remote machine, create (or edit, if it's already present) the file at
`/etc/systemd/system/docker.service`, which let's you override default Docker daemon settings:

```
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375
```

Notice that:
 - The empty `ExecStart=` line removes any previous configuration.
 - The `-H fd://` option enables listening on the Unix socket
 - The `-H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375` option enables listening on the HTTP socket

Next, we'll need to flush the configuration changes onto systemd, and restart the docker daemon
service:

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart docker
```

After this, you may point your local Docker client to the remote engine by setting the `DOCKER_HOST`
environment variable:

```
export DOCKER_HOST=[your-remote-server-address]:2375
```

You're ready to issue commands via `docker` and `docker-compose`\*. Test your connectivity to the
remote engine:

```
docker info
```

#### 1.2: Securing access to the engine

There are some security-wise things you might be wary of at this point:

  * Pushing potentially private code (i.e. Docker Images of your client's apps) and sensitive
  secrets (passwords, etc) into an unknown engine maliciously impersonating your own remote engine.

  * Allow an unauthorized user to run unknown code/processes (i.e. malicious Docker Containers) on
  your remote engine.

These two problems are solved using server and client TLS certificates, and we'll need to create
those, and configure the remote engine to use a secure connection over TCP port 2376, instead of the
previously configured one at port 2375.

(TODO: Write this down...)

### 2: Creating the swarm and adding more nodes to it
