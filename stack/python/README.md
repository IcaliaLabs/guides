# The Best of the Best Practices (BOBP) Guide for Python

This is the guide to write beautiful Python code for your next project. Kudos to [sloria](https://gist.github.com/sloria) and we based this from his [work](https://gist.github.com/sloria/7001839).

## In General

### Values

- "Build tools for others that you want to be built for you." - Kenneth Reitz
- "Simplicity is alway better than functionality." - Pieter Hintjens
- "Fit the 90% use-case. Ignore the nay sayers." - Kenneth Reitz
- "Beautiful is better than ugly." - [PEP 20][]
- Build for open source (even for closed source projects).

### General Development Guidelines

- "Explicit is better than implicit" - [PEP 20][]
- "Readability counts." - [PEP 20][]
- "Anybody can fix anything." - [Khan Academy Development Docs][]
- Fix each [broken window](http://www.artima.com/intv/fixit2.html) (bad design, wrong decision, or poor code) *as soon as it is discovered*.
- "Now is better than never." - [PEP 20][]
- Test ruthlessly. Write docs for new features.
- Even more important that Test-Driven Development--*Human-Driven Development*
- These guidelines may--and probably will--change.

## In Particular

### Style

Follow [PEP 8][], when sensible.

#### Naming

- Variables, functions, methods, packages, modules
    - `lower_case_with_underscores`
- Classes and Exceptions
    - `CapWords`
- Protected methods and internal functions
    - `_single_leading_underscore(self, ...)`
- Private methods
    - `__double_leading_underscore(self, ...)`
- Constants
    - `ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES`

###### General Naming Guidelines 

Avoid one-letter variables (esp. `l`, `O`, `I`). 

*Exception*: In very short blocks, when the meaning is clearly visible from the immediate context

**Fine**
```python
for e in elements:
    e.mutate()
```

Avoid redundant labeling.

**Yes**
```python
import audio

core = audio.Core()
controller = audio.Controller()
```

**No**
```python
import audio

core = audio.AudioCore()
controller = audio.AudioController()
```

Prefer "reverse notation".

**Yes**
```python
elements = ...
elements_active = ...
elements_defunct = ...
```

**No**
```python
elements = ...
active_elements = ...
defunct_elements ...
```

Avoid getter and setter methods.

**Yes**
```python
person.age = 42
```

**No**
```python
person.set_age(42)
```

#### Indentation

Use 4 spaces--never tabs. Enough said.

#### Imports

Import entire modules instead of individual symbols within a module. For example, for a top-level module `canteen` that has a file `canteen/sessions.py`,

**Yes**

```python
import canteen
import canteen.sessions
from canteen import sessions
```

**No**

```python
from canteen import get_user  # Symbol from canteen/__init__.py
from canteen.sessions import get_session  # Symbol from canteen/sessions.py
```

*Exception*: For third-party code where documentation explicitly says to import individual symbols.

*Rationale*: Avoids circular imports. See [here](https://sites.google.com/a/khanacademy.org/forge/for-developers/styleguide/python#TOC-Imports).

Put all imports at the top of the page with three sections, each separated by a blank line, in this order:

1. System imports
2. Third-party imports
3. Local source tree imports

*Rationale*: Makes it clear where each module is coming from.

#### Documentation

Follow [PEP 257][]'s docstring guidelines. [reStructured Text](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html) and [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) can help to enforce these standards.

Use one-line docstrings for obvious functions.

```python
"""Return the pathname of ``foo``."""
```

Multiline docstrings should include

- Summary line
- Use case, if appropriate
- Args
- Return type and semantics, unless ``None`` is returned

```python
"""Train a model to classify Foos and Bars.

Usage::

    >>> import klassify
    >>> data = [("green", "foo"), ("orange", "bar")]
    >>> classifier = klassify.train(data)

:param train_data: A list of tuples of the form ``(color, label)``.
:rtype: A :class:`Classifier <Classifier>`
"""
```

Notes

- Use action words ("Return") rather than descriptions ("Returns").
- Document `__init__` methods in the docstring for the class.

```python
class Person(object):
    """A simple representation of a human being.

    :param name: A string, the person's name.
    :param age: An int, the person's age.
    """
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
```

##### On comments

Use them sparingly. Prefer code readability to writing a lot of comments. Often, small methods are more effective than comments.

*No*

```python
# If the sign is a stop sign
if sign.color == 'red' and sign.sides == 8:
    stop()
```

*Yes*

```python
def is_stop_sign(sign):
    return sign.color == 'red' and sign.sides == 8

if is_stop_sign(sign):
    stop()
```

When you do write comments, remember: "Strunk and White apply." - [PEP 8][]

#### Line lengths

Don't stress over it. 80-100 characters is fine.

Use parentheses for line continuations.

```python
wiki = (
    "The Colt Python is a .357 Magnum caliber revolver formerly manufactured "
    "by Colt's Manufacturing Company of Hartford, Connecticut. It is sometimes "
    'referred to as a "Combat Magnum". It was first introduced in 1955, the '
    "same year as Smith & Wesson's M29 .44 Magnum."
)
```

### Testing

Strive for 100% code coverage, but don't get obsess over the coverage score.

#### General testing guidelines

- Use long, descriptive names. This often obviates the need for doctrings in test methods.
- Tests should be isolated. Don't interact with a real database or network. Use a separate test database that gets torn down or use mock objects.
- Prefer [factories](https://github.com/rbarrois/factory_boy) to fixtures.
- Never let incomplete tests pass, else you run the risk of forgetting about them. Instead, add a placeholder like `assert False, "TODO: finish me"`.

#### Unit Tests

- Focus on one tiny bit of functionality.
- Should be fast, but a slow test is better than no test.
- It often makes sense to have one testcase class for a single class or model.

```python
import unittest
import factories

class PersonTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.person = factories.PersonFactory()

    def test_has_age_in_dog_years(self):
        self.assertEqual(self.person.dog_years, self.person.age / 7)
```

#### Functional Tests

Functional tests are higher level tests that are closer to how an end-user would interact with your application. They are typically used for web and GUI applications.

- Write tests as scenarios. Testcase and test method names should read like a scenario description.
- Use comments to write out stories, *before writing the test code*.

```python
import unittest

class TestAUser(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_can_write_a_blog_post(self):
        # Goes to the her dashboard
        ...
        # Clicks "New Post"
        ...
        # Fills out the post form
        ...
        # Clicks "Submit"
        ...
        # Can see the new post
        ...
```

Notice how the testcase and test method read together like "Test A User can write a blog post".
