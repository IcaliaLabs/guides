Primary guidelines:

* Don't reinvent the wheel, reuse code from gems or plugins
* Be consistent
* Be kind with your teammate
* Don't violate any guideline, unless you can convince another teammate of doing so

Language used on Icalia Guides:

* "Choose" means that there could be multiple options to choose from
* "Use" is a positive declaration
* "Never" there is no reason why you are breaking the statement
* "Abstain" don't do it unless you have a good reason
