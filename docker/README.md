# Docker (or using the thing "the IcaliaLabs Way")

## Available guides:
* [All Things Docker](ALL_THINGS_DOCKER.md): A "First things first" document with info about starting with Docker.
* ["Dockerizing" Rails (and Sinatra) Apps](DOCKERIZING_RAILS_APPS.md): Document with info about using Docker with Rails apps, including some samples.
* ["Dockerizing" Ember (and other client-side Javascript) Apps](DOCKERIZING_EMBER_APPS.md): I bet you didn't knew it can be done.
